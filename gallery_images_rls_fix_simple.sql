-- Simple RLS Fix for gallery_images table
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

-- Enable RLS on gallery_images table
ALTER TABLE gallery_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any existing policies to start fresh

-- Create very permissive policies that should definitely work

-- Allow public read access to all gallery images

-- Allow any authenticated user to delete (very permissive)

-- Also ensure storage policies exist for the gallery bucket
-- Drop any existing storage policies for gallery bucket

-- If you're still getting RLS errors after this, try the nuclear option below:
-- (Uncomment the lines below and comment out the policies above)

/*
-- Nuclear option: Disable RLS entirely for gallery_images table
-- This is the most permissive option - use only if the above doesn't work

-- First, drop all policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to gallery images" ON gallery_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all authenticated users to insert" ON gallery_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all authenticated users to update" ON gallery_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all authenticated users to delete" ON gallery_images;

-- Then disable RLS for the gallery_images table
ALTER TABLE gallery_images DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
